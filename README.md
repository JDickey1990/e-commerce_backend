# E-COMMERCE
Description: Project Framework is a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to signup and login with regular or third party login/signup via google. As a user you have full Create Read Update and Delete(CRUD) functionality for a project and requirement object. The intent of this application is for the user to create a project and set requirements for the project that are tracked with completed and deadline attributes.

# Install Instructions: 
To use this application simply clone the e-commerce_backend, bundle update, rails db:migrate, rails db:seed and then start your rails server by running rails s -p 3001 in your terminal which will bring you to http://localhost3001. From the root path navigating through the application with the links in the view pages is recommended.

Next you will need to clone the e-commerce_frontend, bundle update and run the npm start command in the terminal. The e-commerce store should default the url http://localhost:3000 where you will be able to interface with the application. Redux is being used to mannage the global state so when you refresh the browser it will reset the default state in the store.
